The goal of this project is to create a small web app where users can answer questions, see their score, and learn while playing.

## How It Works

The quiz loads one question at a time.  
Each time a user selects an answer, the app checks if it’s correct and updates the score.  
When all questions are done, the result page appears showing the final score with an option to restart.
